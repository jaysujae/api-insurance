# API Insurance
This is a project for Circle x Tribe bootcamp.

API Insurance is an innovative project that leverages the power of Circle's API and USDC stablecoin to provide users an insurance when a specific API meets / doesn't meet certain pre-defined conditions. 

The project aims to increase trust and reliability in APIs by offering a safety net to users in case of unexpected failures, downtimes, or other issues.


## Overview
Have you ever been annoyed by a broken service and promises? For example, a WhatsApp outage or a delayed delivery that was supposed to arrive today? It's extremely frustrating when companies fail to deliver on their promises and just say, "We're so sorry."

That's why we need API insurance for such situations. By monitoring API responses, we can determine whether a service is up and running and if the guaranteed conditions are met.

So no longer just say "We're so sorry." Give money to us instead!
